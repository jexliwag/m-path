Caffeine is almost completely metabolized with 3% or less being excreted unchanged in urine. The main route of metabolism in humans (70-80%) is via N-3 demethylation to paraxanthine also known as 1,7-dimethylxanthine or 17X. This reaction is carried out by CYP1A2 in the liver. Experiments with human liver microsomes estimate that 1-N- demethylation to theobromine accounts for approximately 7 to 8% of caffeine metabolism with 7-N-demethylation to theophylline also around 7 to 8%. The remaining 15% of caffeine undergoes C-8 hydroxylation to form 1,3,7-trimethyluric acid.

CYP1A2 is responsible for more than 95% of the primary metabolism of caffeine. Therefore caffeine is used as a probe drug for CYP1A2 activity with the relative ratios of urinary metabolites used as an indicator of the flux through different parts of the pathway. As well as paraxanthine, the major metabolites of caffeine in urine are 1-methylxanthine (1X), 1-methyluric acid (1U), 5-acetylamino-6-formylamino-3-methyluracil (AFMU), 1,7-dimethyluric acid (17U). These are formed by the secondary metabolism of paraxanthine by CYP1A2, CYP2A6, NAT2 and XDH (also known as xanthine oxidase or XO). In vitro studies in cell lines show involvement of CYP2E1 in the formation of theobromine and theophylline, whereas studies of recombinant proteins in microsomes do not support this but instead suggest that it contributes to the formation of 1,3,7-trimethyluric acid. Microsome experiments have shown that CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 also participate in the primary metabolism of caffeine.
